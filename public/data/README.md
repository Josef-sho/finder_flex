# Guest List Data

Place your Excel guest list file here with the filename: `guest-list.xlsx`

The file should have:
- Column A: Alternates between table labels (e.g., "Table 1", "Table 2") and guest names
- A header row with "Guest" in column A (optional, will be skipped)

Example structure:
```
Guest
Table 1
John Doe
Jane Smith
Table 2
Bob Johnson
...
```

The app will automatically load this file when it starts, ensuring all devices see the same guest list.
